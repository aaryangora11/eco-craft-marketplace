-Problem Description
Despite increasing awareness about sustainability and social equity, there remains a lack of accessible digital platforms that effectively combine eco-conscious commerce with social empowerment. Individuals from marginalized communities—such as mentally disabled children, war widows, and ex-military personnel—often possess valuable skills but lack the visibility and market access to sell their handmade products. Simultaneously, consumers who wish to support such causes struggle to find authentic, ethically-sourced handmade products online. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a fully functional commercial website that not only promotes recycled paper products but also empowers these communities by providing them with a dignified, digital marketplace.

-Objectives
To develop a user-friendly e-commerce website for selling handmade products made from recycled paper.
To empower mentally disabled children, war widows, and ex-military personnel by providing them with a digital marketplace.
To promote sustainability through the sale of eco-friendly paper products.
To raise awareness about the social impact behind each product by showcasing artisan stories.

-Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to develop a fully functional, user-friendly e-commerce website that serves as a digital marketplace for handmade paper products crafted from recycled materials. The platform will feature products made by mentally disabled children, war widows, and ex-military personnel, offering them a dignified source of income and visibility. The website will include product listings, secure payment integration, creator profiles, and impact stories to promote both environmental sustainability and social empowerment. It aims to connect conscious consumers with meaningful products while supporting underprivileged communities.
